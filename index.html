                        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Jai. I'm a recent graduate from Northern Virginia Community College with Associates in Information Technology and aggressively seeking a career change. </p>
                        
                        <p>Prior to starting my degree in IT, I have been a coach in charge of a youth soccer club leading a group of boy's team 3 promotions in span of 4 seasons from a league called NCSL. Despite such a wonderful time and experience while coaching, I was not being awarded financially for me to see much future in it so I decided that it was time for a change in order for me to improve my situation.</p>
                        
                        <p>So here I am participating in this coding bootcamp. I'm loving it so far. New materials are challenging at times but they are exciting and I'm motivated to learn and improve my skills. Hopefully, We all have mastered all that's required by the end of this program for us to land a job in this ever growing field of web development!</p>
                        
                        <p>Cheers!</p>
